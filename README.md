CSC365 Databases Project

### Programmers:

* Geoff Blaylock: blaylock@calpoly.edu

This API will allow users to quickly access information about their favorite artists, albums, and songs. In particular, this database will focus on rock and roll based music, exploring the different subgenres of music in this area. We will include endpoints that track items like genre, release year, runtime, and more. Users will be able to specify tracks with unique Spotify or Apple Music track IDs, or they can choose to list tracks, albums, or artists based on many sorting and filtering options. Users will also be able to access real time hot charting tracks and albums! Additionally, users will be able to write new music data to the database.
