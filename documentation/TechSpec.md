* Geoff Blaylock: blaylock@calpoly.edu


This API will allow users to quickly access information about their favorite artists, albums, and songs. We will include endpoints that track items like genre, release year, runtime, and more. Or they can choose to list tracks, albums, or artists based on many sorting and filtering options. Additionally, users will be able to write new music data to the database.

**Technical Specification for Music API**

Cole Robinson, Geoff Blaylock

**Overview**

Our music API will hold information on all different aspects of the music industry. The database will consist of multiple schemas such as artist, album, song, and playlist. Utilizing this data, the API will be able to make music recommendations, artist recommendations, album recommendations, and create playlists based on given input. Additionally, the API will have read/write capabilities, allowing users to update the database themselves. 

**User Stories**


1. As a user, I want to search for a specific song, artist, or album so that I can find the desired information quickly.
2. As a musician, I want to add new songs, artists, and albums to the database so my music can be shared with others.
3. As a musician, I would like to be able to update or delete my music from the database.
4. As a user, I want to be able to have a playlist created for me based on my previous song, artist, or album interests. 
5. As a user, I would like to find similar music from individual songs, artists, or albums to broaden my music knowledge.

**Edge Cases**

**1.) Singles:** To handle cases where a user may search for a single that does not belong to an album, we should notify the user. 

**2.) Multiple artist tracks:** In the case that multiple artists are credited for a track, our API should return a data structure that contains data for all artists credited.

**3) Bands:** In the case that users search for a band or group using the artist endpoint, a data structure containing relevant information on all members should be returned.

**4) Input validation:** When input does not correspond to any valid data, make sure to raise a detailed error documenting the issue. 

**5) Multi genre:** In the case that a song or album falls into multiple genres, a data structure containing both genres should be returned. 

**6) Duplicate Entries** In the event that a song, album, or artist potentially gets posted twice, this could lead to undesirable behavior and have transitive effects on other attributes. In order to prevent this, we will make sure that our schema definitions ensure that certain fields are unique. For instance, artist_name will likely be a unique key, as well as the combination of song_id and artist_id. 

**7) Missing/Incomplete Data** In the event that a song, album, or artist potentially gets posted twice, this could lead to undesirable behavior and have transitive effects on other attributes. In order to prevent this, we will make sure that our schema definitions ensure that certain fields are unique. For instance, artist_name will likely be a unique key, as well as the combination of song_id and artist_id. 

**8)Large Requests** Our query parameters for the search function will help to limit the amount of data requested by the user. Though we may decide to define a hard limit on the amount of data returned, if this proves to be an issue.
